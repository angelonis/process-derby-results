            This small app was created in helping with processing the results of the Pinewood Derby for Pack 11 Coventry.
            <br></br>              
            At the time of developing this, we used <a href="https://derbynet.org/" target="_blank">DerbyNet</a>. Due to the way we run our races the export file has all scouts combined. 
            <br></br>
            We need to parse that data in order to seperate out the rankings for each den as well as the pack.
